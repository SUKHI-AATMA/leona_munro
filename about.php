                    <p class="animated" data-anim="slideInUp">Leona’s actions and the sales she achieves for her clients speak louder than mere words. She is a Ray White multi-award winning agent recognised time-and-again for her exceptional customer service and attention to detail.

                    <p class="moreTxt">Dunedin born and bred, Leona truly goes further to ensure every property she sells is presented at its best, encouraging buyer interest and maximising sales results. She won't rush a property to market, Leona works with sellers using her impeccable sense of style and understanding of the local real estate market to ensure every house she sells looks outstanding for photos and open homes.</p>

                 <p>Leona's eye for detail which helps guide sellers in property presentation is again brought to the fore when it comes to marketing the home. Sure, in a busy market like Dunedin any agent can sell a house but Leona, supported by her assistant Mike Burn, maximises the number of people visiting each house over a campaign of at least two weeks to ensure the best result. Over more than 15 years specialising in the Dunedin property market, Leona has developed a specialist team of tradespeople to assist making houses sale ready. Not only is Leona's team reliable (which in itself is worth gold) but they also offer sellers competitive pricing - and in many cases wholesale rates.</p>
 

                <p>Experience and knowledge comes to the fore with Leona's understanding of real estate sales legislation and contractual obligations, another way she supports sellers and buyers and ensuring she provides a stress free experience for her clients.</p>

                <p>Then, there's the actual sale, Leona is known for turning on ‘something extra' for auctions - she's had bagpipers play, on another occasion she served champagne and nibbles and has had coffee trucks on hand for sustenance.</p>

                <p>All this attention to detail, practical support and Dunedin real estate sales knowledge are why Leona Munro consistently receives a customer satisfaction ratings of 10 of out 10 - in other words top marks at 100%. Leona Munro is judged upon her results and that's the way she prefers it.</p>

                <p>Open homes overseen by Leona and Mike are proof of attention to detail. Leona and Mike are warm and welcoming to everyone visiting the property and - more importantly – follow up every single open home visitor. They provide detailed information packs at the open home and then work with potential buyers to ensure they are a in a good position to make an offer, that may mean once again using her connections to introduce buyers to mortgage brokers and lawyers. Experience and knowledge comes to the fore with Leona's understanding of real estate sales legislation and contractual obligations, another way she supports sellers and buyers and ensuring she provides a stress free experience for her clients.</p>
                <p>Weekly reports with feedback throughout the open home and sales process ensure sellers receive buyer feedback and clear guidance on value of their property.
