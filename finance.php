                    <p class="animated delay-400s" data-anim="slideInUp">Home loan pre-approval is an indication from your lender that you would be approved for finance up to a certain amount if nothing changes. It allows you to bid with confidence at auctions and make offers on property, knowing that the bank will most likely approve a loan to finance your purchase.</p>
                    <p class="animated delay-400s" data-anim="slideInUp"> This pre-approval is usually free and valid for three to six months, plus having it may make your formal approval easier when it comes time.</p>
